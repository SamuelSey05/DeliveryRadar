/**
 * This is the initialization function that gets called when the SDK is first loaded. This is actually the entrypoint
 * to the SDK. This is always called when the script is loaded on first load, and only once on first load.
 *
 * 1. The SDK when loaded first pulls any of the parameters provided when it was loaded and sets the options for them
 *    for API requests using the SDK.
 * 2. The SDK is also attached to the window DOM if it is available. (It currently does not rety in the case of failure
 *    or if the DOM is not yet accessible.)
 * 3. The callback if provided and available is called at the end of the pre-load script.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Add a retry for attaching SDK to window with some backoff
 * - Could add some monitoring here to inform us of SDK usage. (Added what3words_session_id to the window - more needed)
 * - Any other async pre-load behaviour should occur here. See https://stenciljs.com/docs/config#globalscript
